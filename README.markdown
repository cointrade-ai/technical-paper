## Technical Architecture

CoinTrade‚Äôs architecture is designed for performance, scalability, and intelligence, leveraging modern web and AI technologies to deliver a superior trading experience.

### Architecture Overview

CoinTrade comprises four core layers:

- **Frontend Layer**: A responsive interface built with [React 18](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for real-time visualizations and user interaction.
- **Backend Services**: Powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and the [Haystack framework](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) for AI-driven trading logic and seamless integrations.
- **Data Layer**: [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) vector databases store market, trading, and sentiment data for rapid retrieval.
- **Integration Layer**: Connects to [Binance APIs](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api) for trade execution, WebSocket streams for real-time data, and Web3 protocols for marketplace transactions via [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/).

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

CoinTrade‚Äôs technical supremacy is driven by its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which combines advanced information retrieval with generative AI to produce precise trading signals. Powered by [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), the RAG model synthesizes market trends, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis to deliver context-aware trading decisions.

**Key Components**:

- **Document Store ([Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/))**:
  - **Market Data**: Price, volume, and market cap from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).
  - **Trading Data**: Candlestick data and indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI, MACD) from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/).
  - **Sentiment Data**: News and [X](https://x.com/) posts with sentiment scores via [finBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finBERT).
- **Embedder**: Uses [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to create vector embeddings for efficient data retrieval.
- **Retriever**: Employs [WeaviateHybridRetriever](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/weaviate) for hybrid search (BM25 and dense), fetching the most relevant data.
- **Generator**: Leverages [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)‚Äôs LLaMA 3.1 70B to generate trading strategies based on retrieved data and user inputs.

**RAG Workflow**:

1. Users input trading preferences (e.g., ‚ÄúFind oversold BTC/USDT with positive sentiment‚Äù) via the frontend or AI chat interface.
2. The retriever fetches relevant data from Weaviate‚Äôs vector databases.
3. The generator analyzes data, applying the confluence trading strategy to produce actionable signals.
4. Signals are displayed on the dashboard, used in the AI chat interface, or executed via [Binance APIs](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api).

This RAG approach ensures CoinTrade delivers highly accurate, context-aware trading decisions, distinguishing it from traditional trading platforms.

### Data Flow

- **Ingestion**: Real-time market data ([Binance WebSocket](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)) and sentiment data ([X](https://x.com/) posts, news) are processed and stored in [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).
- **Processing**: Technical indicators are computed and embedded for retrieval.
- **Decision Making**: The RAG pipeline generates trading signals based on market conditions and user parameters.
- **Execution**: Trades are executed with risk management controls via [Binance APIs](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api).

## Core Features
